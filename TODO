[TODO]
- For Brute force test: add an option to choose the number of checks to do. With the increase of the max process number, duration of brute test becomes very long.
  So (very) short live processes, appearing and disappearing during the brute test, start to give some false positives even with double check.
  At least make double check the default.
  The more the number of runs the less the number of false positives.
- Integrate -m in other test,
- Try to factorize the code,
- More optimizations,
- Add a mail sending option,
- Beautify the source (add comments, function headers, etc.),
- Add a version number beside date of release,
- Localize (have you already used gettext ?), create man pages in other language
- Add an install script or use autotools/cmake/something else.
- Upgrade the generic version of unhide with some of the enhancements of the
  linux26 version.
- Others ...


[DONE]
- Make a meta proc test that involves all /proc test (proc and procfs)
- Add more verbosity level,
- Sanitize the exit code,
- Make a better command line parsing (without getopt:),
- Put it in a CVS/SVN/Git repo, unhide is on sourceforge.
- Create a TODO file :), you're reading it
- Add an option (-x for expert ?) which allows to run subtest individually.
   Done without the use of a special option
- Add a option (-f ) to create a log file, (not everybody use unhide via RKH)
- Add a test script to reliably test new version (preliminary version).
